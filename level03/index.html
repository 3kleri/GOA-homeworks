<p>Life, it seems, will fade away
    Drifting further, every day
    Getting lost within myself
    Nothing matters, no one else
    I have lost the will to live
    Simply nothing more to give
    There is nothing more for me
    Need the end to set me free
    Things not what they used to be
    Missing one inside of me
    Deathly loss, this can't be real
    I cannot stand this hell I feel
    Emptiness is filling me
    To the point of agony
    Growing darkness, taking dawn
    I was me, but now he's gone
    No one but me
    Can save myself
    But it's too late
    Now I can't think
    Think why I should even try
    Yesterday seems as though
    It never existed
    Death greets me warm
    Now I will just say goodbye
    Bye...</p>
